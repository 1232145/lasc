              The Senior Center of Littlestown was established in 1975 as a
              program for senior citizens of the Littlestown Borough and the
              townships of Germany, Mt. Joy, Mt. Pleasant, and Union. It began
              with the support of the Office of Aging, renting space at
              Centenary United Methodist Church Hall.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1983, the center sought a permanent home and was incorporated
              as a non-profit organization. By September 1985, the Board
              purchased the building at <strong>10 Locust Street</strong>, and
              renovations began under the direction of John Jacobs in January
              1986.
            </p>
            <p>
              The grand opening was held in May 1986 in celebration of Senior
              Citizens Month — featuring a ribbon cutting on May 1st at 11:30 AM
              and an Open House on May 4th. That summer, the Office of Aging
              approved installation of central air conditioning, improving the
              center’s comfort for members and guests.
